    "This final project explores the best locations for Japanese restaurants throughout the city of New York. As New York is the most diverse city in the world (800 languages are spoken in New York), it has a long tradition of different ethnical restaurants. Now when the idea of a healthy lifestyle conquered the minds of people all over the country, Japanese restaurants became extremely popular, as they offer a healthy alternative to regular American eating habits. That's why Potentially the owner of the new East European restaurant can have great success and consistent profit. However, as with any business, opening a new restaurant requires serious considerations and is more complicated than it seems from the first glance. In particular, the location of the restaurant is one of the most important factors that will affect whether it will have success or a failure. So our project will attempt to answer the questions “Where should the investor open a Japanese Restaurant?” and “Where should I go If I want great Japanese food?”"
